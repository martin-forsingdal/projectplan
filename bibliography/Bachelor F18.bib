@misc{Wiki2017,
abstract = {To provide communication between various daemons and applications in OpenWrt a project called ubus has been developed. It consists of several parts including daemon, library and some extra helpers. The heart of this project is the ubusd daemon. It provides an interface for other daemons to register themselves as well as sending messages. For those curious, this interface is implemented using Unix sockets and it uses TLV (type-length-value) messages. To simplify development of software using ubus (connecting to it) a library called libubus has been created. Every daemon registers a set of paths under a specific namespace. Every path can provide multiple procedures with any number of arguments. Procedures can reply with a message. The code is published under LGPL 2.1 and can be found via git at http://git.openwrt.org/project/ubus.git. It's included in OpenWrt since r28499.},

@book{Fraden2010a,
abstract = {September 11 has changed the way people think about airport, aviation, and security in general. The threat is expanding interest in more reliable systems to detect presence of people within the protected perimeters. The occupancy sensors detect the presence of people (and sometimes animals) in a monitored area. Motion detectors respond only to moving objects. A distinction between the two is that the occupancy sensors produce signals whenever an object is stationary or not, while the motion detectors are selectively sensitive to moving objects. The applications of these sensors include security, surveillance, energy management (electric lights control ), personal safety, friendly home appliances, point-of-sale advertisements, interactive toys, novelty products, etc.},
